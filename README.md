# Dentist-Appointment-System---WPF-Application

This project is a simple dentist appointment management system developed using **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)** in C#. It was created as part of the **"Programmeren" course** by a student of **Graduaat Programmeren** at VIVES University of Applied Sciences.

##  Description

The application allows:
- Patient registration (with name and surname)
- Queueing for appointments
- Sending patients to the dentist
- Recording treatment results (cavities and cleaning)
- Viewing completed treatments

The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate understanding of WPF, data structures (such as dictionaries, queues, and lists), and event-driven programming in C#.

##  Technologies Used

- C# (.NET Framework)
- WPF (XAML)
- Visual Studio

##  Project Structure

- `Tandarts.xaml` — UI layout (XAML)
- `Tandarts.xaml.cs` — Code-behind logic for UI interactions
- `App.xaml` and `App.xaml.cs` — Application startup configuration
- `AssemblyInfo.cs` — Metadata and resources configuration
- `Ozturk_Batuhan_PE1.csproj` — Project file
- `Ozturk_Batuhan_PE1.sln` — Visual Studio solution file

##  How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Interact with the GUI to register, queue, and treat patients.
